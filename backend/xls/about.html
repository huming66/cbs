		<li>This application is to demo how to manage and organize data (information) with complication of related technical &amp; business context, by using multiple levels (layer) &amp; hierarchies (tree) interaction
		<ul>
		<li>multiple hierarchies: to organize the complicate relations</li>
		<li>multiple levels: to decouple the complication</li>
		</ul>
		</li>

		<li>Taking transmission cost estimate as example application:
		<ul>
		<li>organize technical &amp; cost details of large number of transmission components by using detail hierarchies</li>
		<li>components =&gt; facility =&gt; project =&gt; scenario (plan)</li>
		<li>to support transparent, consistent and efficient transmission project cost estimation and related communication</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		<li>This simple concept (multiple levels &amp; hierarchies) should be applicable to handle similar issues involving data (information) with complication</li>
